## General Features

## Navigation and Hero Section

I decided to make a self-explanatory hero setion using a royalty free photo which clearly conveys the purpose of the camera club.

Featured on all three pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Gallery and Sign Up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

## Benefits Section

The Benefits section will allow the user to see the benefits of joining the All Dublin Camera Club meetups, as well as the benefits of photography overall.
This user will see the value of signing up for the All Dublin Camera Club meetups. This should encourage the user to consider photography as one of their forms of socialising.

## Meetup Times Section

This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the photography session duration will be.
This section will be updated as these times change to keep the user up to date.
